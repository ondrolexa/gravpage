Most of the recent developement moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/ondrolexa) and is based on Python. I recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to run my software. You can either install it (if available) from my [Anaconda personal repository](https://anaconda.org/ondrolexa/repo) or follow install instructions in documentation.
